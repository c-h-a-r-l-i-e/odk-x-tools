This repository contains the ODK Application Designer 2.0 software.

Complete Android apps, including data entry, synchronization, and distribution,
can be written using HTML and JavaScript files. ODK Tables and ODK Survey will
serve these files as the skin of your app.

Projects intending to write a Tables app can clone this repository and use it
as a starting point.

Much of the boilerplate of app creation can be avoided by employing the Grunt
tasks specified in the Gruntfile.

For a more complete description of how to use this repository, please see our
user documentation at:

Suggestions and corrections are welcomed in our efforts to make the
documentation more complete and the data collection application design 
process easier. Please send to:
